--------------------------
This repository contains the matlab scripts used for OBS controller design, Simulink models used for generation of real-time control scripts, and the deployable real-time code for usage on embeded hardware. The design of this Linear Inverted Pendulum System (LIPS) is a custom-design and as such this controller should not be deployed to any other hardware than the equipment it was designed for.
